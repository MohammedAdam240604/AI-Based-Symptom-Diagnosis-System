# AI-Based Symptom Diagnosis System

An AI-powered web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms. Built using a machine learning model (XGBoost) and served through a Flask-based interactive interface. The app accepts natural language input and provides predictions, advice, probability charts, and downloadable PDF reports.
